# Docker Image Artifact

Module providing functionality for uploading and downloading docker images in a github action workflow across jobs. It leverages github artifact in the background.


It exposes two public methods from ![main script](https://github.com/ishworkh/docker-image-artifact/blob/master/src/image_artifact.js) namely `upload` and `download`.
